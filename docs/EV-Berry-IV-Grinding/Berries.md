## Berry Grinding

- Berries can be grown for free by planting in the berry patches. Certain berries are locked behind quests.							
- Trees progress through time spent in runs. The more routes and events participated in a run, the further along the tree progresses.							
- Upgrades in the Berry Field area can increase the amount of berries obtained from a berry tree, max is 9 berries.							
- Unlocked berries can also be bought for 2500 Pok√© each. You will need to do this for any berries you are not given through quests.

Too much time away can cause trees to disappear, leaving no berries behind. Keep an eye on the trees between runs!
