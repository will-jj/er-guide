## IV Grinding

### In the Hub

Pokéblocks can be used to raise a Pokémon's IVs in the Bakery in the HUB. You will need 3 Pokéblocks of a matching type of the Pokémon you want to feed, and then some Pokéblocks of the stat you want to raise.												
The Pies themselves will require a certain number of a stat Pokéblock to raise, and each Pie gives a certain amount of an IV stat.:

|Pie Size | Cost [Pokéblocks] | IV Increase|
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| Small | 3 | 1|
| Medium |6 | 5 |
| Large | 9 | 10|

										
There is an NPC in the Market that can let you know what berries to grow if you want to make Pokéblocks, or you can buy the needed Pokéblocks directly for 1500 each through another Market NPC.

### On Routes

Battle Simulator can also increase/decrease IVs, but this is the only IV change that is not permanent.

Strength Charms and Curses can adjust the IVs of wild Pokémon.
